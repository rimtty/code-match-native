/**
 * Deterministic discovery/connection/reconnection coordinator.
 *
 * The platform adapter owns Android Bluetooth callbacks. This class owns the
 * app-visible state and persistence-independent reconnect policy. Call
 * [onTransportEvent] from the adapter's serialized callback context and call
 * [tick] from the host coroutine/timer to perform deadline handling and a
 * scheduled reconnect. Discovery, connection, and reconnect deadlines are
 * respectively 5s, 30s, and 8s by default.
 *
 * Adapters that can tag callbacks should copy [pendingRequestGeneration] and
 * [pendingLinkGeneration] into connection events, and the accepted current
 * tokens into scan/disconnect events. Untagged legacy events are accepted only
 * when their device and current state make them unambiguous.
